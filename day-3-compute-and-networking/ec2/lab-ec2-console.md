# LAB: EC2 (Console)

Navigate to the EC2 console. You may land on a different page, either the EC2 Dashboard or Instances.&#x20;

In both cases you should see an orange **Launch instances** button.&#x20;

## Create instance

* click on Create instance

You will most likely see the new console experience, which looks like this:&#x20;
