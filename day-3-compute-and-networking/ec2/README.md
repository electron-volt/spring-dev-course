# EC2

Amazon EC2 stands for Elastic Compute Cloud. Or Elastic Cloud Compute. I can never remember which. Anyway, it's Infrastructure as a Service.

EC2 instances are basically virtual machines running in the cloud. They come in different instance types, like

* memory optimized
* compute optimized
* general purpose.&#x20;
