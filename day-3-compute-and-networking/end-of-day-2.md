## Clean up&#x20;

Please make sure the following resources have been deleted:

* all running EC2 instances
* the VPC's that you created
* the auto scaling group.

## What have we learned today

* to build our own VPC's
* create automatic monitoring and alerting for AWS resources
* to launch EC2 instances on demand or automatically with auto-scaling.
