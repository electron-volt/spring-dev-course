# Day 3: compute and networking

## Schedule

* 09:00-11:30 VPC, EC2
* 11:30-12:30 Lunch
* 12:30-16:00 EBS, CloudWatch, Auto-scaling&#x20;

## VPC's

Today we are going to build our own virtual networks in the AWS cloud.&#x20;

Don't worry if you don't have a background in networking, we will walk you through all the necessary steps.&#x20;

## EC2&#x20;

We've seen how to build serverless solutions in the AWS cloud. Now let's look at more traditional compute services like virtual computers running in the cloud.&#x20;

## CloudWatch

The go-to place for all logging and monitoring in AWS.&#x20;

## Auto-scaling

Now we finally get to enjoy some of the real benefits of cloud computing: scalability and automation. &#x20;
