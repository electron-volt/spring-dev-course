# Day 1: Serverless

## Schedule

* 09:00-09:30 Set-up
* 09:30-11:00 Lambda
* 11:00-12:00 Lunch
* 12:00-16:00 DynamoDB, API Gateway

### Setting things up&#x20;

Let's make sure you have access to your AWS accounts. All of our labs can be done via the AWS console, but there are optional CLI labs as well. You can do these by installing the AWS CLI locally OR using CloudShell. We will have time during the set up phase to either install the CLI or get acquainted with CloudShell.&#x20;

### Lambda

AWS's serverless compute service: run code in response to events without managing servers.&#x20;

### DynamoDB

Schemaless NoSQL database with millisecond latency and push-button scalability.&#x20;

### API Gateway&#x20;

Build and deploy API's.&#x20;

### Last lab of the day: Serverless CRUD

We will put what we have learned to good use and build a simple CRUD operation API using API Gateway, DynamoDB and AWS Lambda.&#x20;
