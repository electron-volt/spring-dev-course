# 🍹 End of day 1

## Congratulations!&#x20;

What have we learned? We are able to build workable solutions and get them up and running without buying, configuring or maintaining a single server ourselves.&#x20;

## Clean up after day 1

Let's delete the resources that we created today.&#x20;

### Lambda

Delete

* Lambda functions from the Lambda console
* Lambda function's execution roles from IAM > roles (note: only delete the roles of the functions you created today).&#x20;

### DynamoDB

Delete

* Tables&#x20;

### API Gateway&#x20;

Delete&#x20;

* API's

### Optional: CloudWatch&#x20;

We have not covered CloudWatch today. However if you like, you can navigate to CloudWatch where you will find log groups for your Lambda functions. There might also be autoscaling alarms for DynamoDB tables. These can be deleted.
