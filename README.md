# üçí Course overview

## Agenda for the course

We will cover the following topics over the next five Tuesdays:

1. Serverless technologies
2. Compute services, networking
3. Load balancing, Infrastructure as Code
4. Containers
5. Developer tools.

The material is also suitable for self-study.&#x20;

## Hands-on labs

The course will feature many hands-on labs. To do these you will need access to an AWS account.&#x20;

### Costs

If you are using a personal AWS account, then it is best to create a budget that will alert you if your resources are generating unexpected costs. You can find instructions for creating budgets here: [https://eve-4.gitbook.io/developer-associate-intensive-course/day-1/setting-up/lab-create-an-aws-account#create-your-aws-account](https://eve-4.gitbook.io/developer-associate-intensive-course/day-1/setting-up/lab-create-an-aws-account#create-your-aws-account).

### Shared accounts

If you are using an AWS account that is shared with other users also doing the same hands-on labs, then add your own first name to the name of your resources. For example if you are creating a Lambda function and your name is John, call the function John-lambda.&#x20;

### Tags

Almost all AWS resources can have tags. These are simple key-value pairs that help you categorize and document your resources. Using tags is optional, but it will make cleaning up after labs easier.

## What to expect

We will go through most of the material required to pass the AWS Developer Associate course. The focus is on hands-on labs rather than theory.&#x20;

### What will I need?&#x20;

Access to an AWS account. Ideally your user account should have admin-level access. A good text editor will also come in handy.

### What kind of skills will I need?&#x20;

Some experience with Bash shells and Git are useful, but not mandatory. You do not need to know how to write any code. All steps required to complete the labs will be given to you and all text snippets can be copy-pasted.&#x20;

### What kind of AWS background am I expected to have?&#x20;

We assume familiarity with some basic cloud computing concepts such as

* Elasticity, high availability, scalability, fault-tolerance.

We also assume students have some high-level understanding of the following AWS concepts:

* Global infrastructure of AWS: regions, availability zones
* The basics of IAM: users, groups, policies, roles.

Next up is a quick primer on these AWS concepts. You can skip it if you already know the concepts mentioned above.&#x20;
