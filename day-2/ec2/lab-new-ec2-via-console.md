# LAB: NEW EC2 via console

AWS like to change the GUI of their console almost on a weekly basis, it seems. Now they have changed the EC2 launch wizard.&#x20;

If you navigate to EC2 > instances > launch instance, you may be greeted by the new console layout:

The steps remain the same as ever, the default settings remain the same:

The default instance type is free tier eligible.&#x20;

The functionality for key pairs has changed the most:
